# DebateHub

## Overview
DebateHub is an AI-powered platform that simulates structured debates between two agents, one arguing for and the other against a topic. A third AI agent acts as an impartial judge, evaluating the arguments and providing a summary with scores. This tool helps users explore multiple perspectives and make more informed decisions.

## Features
- **Dual AI Agents**: Engage in a structured debate with opposing viewpoints.
- **Impartial AI Judge**: Evaluates argument strength, evidence, and rebuttal quality, and declares a winner.
- **Comprehensive Summary**: Users receive a clear, balanced summary of the debate.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: Enter a topic and specify the number of debate turns.
2. **Structured Debate**: Two agents take turns arguing for and against the topic.
3. **Evaluation**: The judge agent reviews the debate, scores each side, and provides a summary.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenAI Python Library**
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash Model**
- **OpenRouter API**

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating automated research capabilities for evidence-based arguments.
- Enhancing the scoring system for improved analysis of logic and source reliability.
